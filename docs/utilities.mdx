# Utilities

For faster mobile-friendly and responsive development, the Emotion grid includes some utilities for styling, showing, hiding, and debugging.

## Media

Media query helper, this ensure you use the same grid breakpoints from config, we use **em** on _media query_, and you can check [here](https://zellwk.com/blog/media-query-units/) the why.

```jsx
import { css } from '@emotion/react';
import { media } from '@mverissimoo/emotion-grid';

const baseStyles = ({ theme }) => css`
  ${media('lg')} {
    // your code below
  }
`;
```

#### Output

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 64em) {
  // your code below
}
```

## Screen Class

Return a component with the current breakpoint.

> Try to resize your window to see the change.

<Playground>
  <ScreenClass render={(screen) => <span>Current screen is {screen}</span>} />
</Playground>

## Visible

Show an element only in a specific breakpoint.

> Try to resize your window to see the change.

<Playground>
  <Visible md xl>
    <span>Visible only in MD and XL</span>
  </Visible>
</Playground>

## Hidden

Hide an element only in a specific breakpoint.

> Try to resize your window to see the change.

<Playground>
  <Hidden md>
    <span>Hide only in MD</span>
  </Hidden>
</Playground>

## Debugger

Provide a way to visualize all grid columns without passing debug direct to the component and show the current breakpoint.

> Try clicking on the button in the footer on the right

```jsx
process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && <Debugger />;
```

<Debugger />
